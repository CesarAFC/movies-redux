# Trending Movies App
The Trending Movies App is a web application that allows users to browse and discover popular and trending movies. Users can view movie details, ratings, reviews. The application is built using React and utilizes data from a third-party API. The application is built using React, React Query, Redux, ErrorBoundary, and MaterialUI. React is a popular front-end framework that makes it easy to build complex UI components. React Query is a library that provides an efficient way to fetch data from APIs and cache the results for better performance. Redux is a state management library that helps manage the state of the application across various components. ErrorBoundary is a component provided by React that helps handle errors and prevents the app from crashing.
MaterialUI is a popular UI component library that provides pre-built components like buttons, forms, and tables that follow Material Design guidelines. This makes it easy to create a visually appealing and responsive interface.
By using React, React Query, Redux, ErrorBoundary, and MaterialUI, we aim to create a high-quality application that is both performant and visually appealing.
